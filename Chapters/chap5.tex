\chapter{Recommendations}\label{chap:recommendations}

In this chapter major recommendations are detailed. Firstly our experiment process is described and then possible best options ae chosen as recommendation.
Based on analysis we devised certain algorithms and discussed their outputs. Lastly some areas for future research is suggested.

\section{Experiments Process}
There are certain hyper-parameters from which we need to choose as explained in \ref{chap:hyperparams}. For that we choose following set of dictionaries [TBD]



\subsection{batch size}
Chapter \ref{chap:hyperparams} has shown lot of results on batch sizes as multiple of class size plays a big role in better accuracy. Here we will see all the experiments performed and their results with respect to class size.
