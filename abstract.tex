Neural networks generated lot of interest and constantly created new bench marks in recent times which were never imagined. Certain cases it is able to pass human level performance. However it comes with lot of challenges and specifically optimization of these networks poses lot of challenges. In this work we will try to uncover these aspects.
Network optimization aspects are studied in great detail in this work and experimentations with many possible configurations are performed on datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR 100.
Experimental results are analysed and on their basis recommendations are suggested which could help in better convergence performance and able to generate robust classifiers.
